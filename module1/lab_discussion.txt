Step 10 Answer:
Using placeholders is central to the wireframing process when desinging the layout of a new webpage. Three main reasons to use webpage 
placeholders are:
    1. Using placeholders helps in setting up a structural design of the webpage. It allows the designer to determine where layout elements
       should go before coding the layout. This also saves time in development so that the webpage framework (such as HTML or CSS) is not
       being rewritten multiple times.
    2. Using placeholders allows for the webpage developers to continue with development without being blocked due to missing content, such
       as a missing image, mission statement, or platform logo.
    3. Using placeholders helps to provide clear communication and visualization of the content or data that the clients need to provide.

Step 9 Answer:
Five reasons for using a Call to Action (CTA) are:
    1. A clear Call-to-Action results in a very effective and clear user experience. This results in reducing the user's confusion and any fatigue
       experienced when using the website, thus making the user's experience and usage seamless. 
    2. Call-to-Actions can help in growing an audience. For example, when the call-to-action is to follow a personal or corporate social media
       account, website clients may then choose to follow that account for more regualr updates. This can establish a more personal connection
       with the website client, which can then allow for more personalized marketing and potentially increase in sales.
    3. Call-to-Actions help to lower webpage complexity by ensuring that each added piece of content is useful and assists in engaging with
       the website client.
    4. Call-to-Actions can provide a medium in which your website can gain more information about the user, such as subscriber form that
       collects name, location, and email fields. Some of this info can then be used to get in contact with the user as a later time
       or for more user security (eg. email confirmations and verifications).
    5. Call-to-Actions can also provide leads to other websites and services that provide more information for the user or better assist the
       user's needs. An example of this would be a lead to more product details or product reviews on an ecommerce website, which could help 
       convince a user to purchase the product.
Five techniques for drawing attention to CTAs are:
    1. Using good word choice to clearly and precisley communicate the CTA.
    2. Creating a sense of urgency can help to convince the user to complete the CTA more quickly (rather than later when they are likely to forget).
    3. Crating low risk of commitment CTAs (eg. user does not need to provide person information to get what they need) allows the user to be more
       comfortable and trusing of the website. 
    4. Using color and layout can help to draw the user's attention to the CTA.
    5. Using images to also help draw the user's attention to the CTA.

Step 10 Answer:
The benefits of entering the wireframe HTML elements such as header, nav, <div id="main">, and footer before entering the textual content for
the webpage is that these elements provide a cohesive structural design and framework for the webpage and for multiple webpages on a single
website. By consistently using these wireframe elements across all webpages on the website it creates a seamless user experience, which is
important when reducing user confusion and navigation fatigue. Also, these wireframe elements are used in other websites as well, which
results in the user having familiarity with your website even if they have not visited it before. Lastly, it is beneficial to use the wireframe
HTML elements because they help segment sections of the code into distinct tags, which assists with overall code readability and when making
changes and feature additions to the website's code.

Step 10 Answer:
Some of the negative impressions that users might get are:
    * A sense of unreliability for both the website and the person or company's brand, hence huring credibility.
    * Communication to the user can be diminished by poor spelling and grammar, which increases user confusion and frustration. This can then
      result in the user being unable to perform the desired Call-to-Actions.
