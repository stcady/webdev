The JSX code in App.jsx was compiled into JavaScript code. The JSX shorthand for creating a component has been converted into the React.createElement() function call.

The --save-dev command input parameter was used when installing babel-cli because when compiling the development code into deployable pre-build production code to enable the production application to run without the need for the babel-cli installation in the production environment.

babel <input directory> --presets <transformation library> --out-dir <output directory>
1. The first input parameter "src" is the input directory that contins the JSX code files to be compiled to JS.
2. The presets input parameter "react" specifies to use the React transformation libraries.
3. The out-dir input parameter "static" is the output directory that will contain the output JS file after compilation.

We will use the es2015 transform.
